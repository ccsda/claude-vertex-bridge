ry Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 (Vertex AI API - cURL)
Note: It is always recommended to utilize the pinned version of the model to ensure consistent behavior and avoid potential disruptions to existing workflows when model updates occur.

The following is a sample prompt to the model. To learn more about the possible request parameters, see the Claude Messages API Reference.

Note that the API for Claude on Vertex differs from the Anthropic API documentation in the following ways:

model is not a valid parameter. The model is instead specified in the Google Cloud endpoint URL.
anthropic_version is a required parameter and must be set to "vertex-2023-10-16".
Also note that the Anthropic Text Completions API is not available on Vertex AI.

Request JSON body:

For the media type field, Claude 3 models support image/png, image/jpeg, image/gif, or image/webp. The data part of the image is the file bytes encoded to a base64 string (e.g. base64 -i my_image.png).

  "anthropic_version": "vertex-2023-10-16",
  "messages": [

        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "max_tokens": 256,
  "stream": true
}Set stream to true to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events. Streaming substantially reduces end-user perception of latency, because the response is returned incrementally as it's generated.

Save the request body in a file named request.json and then execute the following command in Cloud Shell or a local terminal window with the gcloud CLI installed. Authenticate and replace PROJECT_ID with your Google Cloud project ID.
PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-v2@20241022

# Pick one region:
LOCATION=us-east5

Try Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 (Anthropic's Vertex SDK)
Note: It is always recommended to utilize the pinned version of the model to ensure consistent behavior and avoid potential disruptions to existing workflows when model updates occur.

There are Anthropic SDKs available for Python and TypeScript.

To install the Anthropic Python SDK:
python -m pip install -U 'anthropic[vertex]'
from anthropic import AnthropicVertex

LOCATION="us-east5" # or "europe-west1"

client = AnthropicVertex(region=LOCATION, project_id="PROJECT_ID")

message = client.messages.create(
  max_tokens=1024,
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Send me a recipe for banana bread.",
    }
  ],
  model="claude-3-5-sonnet-v2@20241022",
)
print(message.model_dump_json(indent=2))
To use the SDK to stream messages:

from anthropic import AnthropicVertex

LOCATION="us-east5" # or "europe-west1"

client = AnthropicVertex(region=LOCATION, project_id="PROJECT_ID")

with client.messages.stream(
  max_tokens=1024,
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Send me a recipe for banana bread.",
    }
  ],
  model="claude-3-5-sonnet-v2@20241022",
) as stream:
  for text in stream.text_stream:
    print(text)
    To use the SDK to process images:

import base64
import httpx
from anthropic import AnthropicVertex

LOCATION="us-east5" # or "europe-west1"

client = AnthropicVertex(region=LOCATION, project_id="PROJECT_ID")

image1_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Camponotus_flavomarginatus_ant.jpg"
image1_media_type = "image/jpeg"
image1_data = base64.b64encode(httpx.get(image1_url).content).decode("utf-8")

message = client.messages.create(
  max_tokens=1024,
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "image",
          "source": {
            "type": "base64",
            "media_type": image1_media_type,
            "data": image1_data,
          },
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Describe this image."
        }
      ],
    }
  ],
